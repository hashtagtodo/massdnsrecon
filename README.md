Here is the translated text with the requested commands inserted:

A Python script designed to run on Kali Linux, using the tools DNS Recon, Whois, and DNS Enum, allows you to find and extract information from any domain with all possible top-level domains (TLDs). The script generates an output file with all the obtained information.

You need to have the tools dnsrecon, whois, and dnsenum installed for it to work correctly. If you don't have them, please refer to the official Kali Linux documentation.

Instructions for use:

1. Download the git

```sh git clone https://github.com/hashtagtodo/massdnsrecon.git ```

2. Install the requirements

 ```sh pip install -r requirements.txt ```

3. When you run the script, it will ask for the target domain. You should enter the domain without any extension, for example: domainexample
With this, the script will search among all possible extensions like .com, .net, .org, etc.
